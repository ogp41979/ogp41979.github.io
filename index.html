	<h1>2017 Spring Break: Costa Rica</h1>
	<p>This past spring break I was lucky enough to travel to Costa Rica, through the UGA Catholic Center. The town we
		went to was called San Luis, it's nestled in the bottom on the Cloud Forest. Our main project was to help a man named
		Olivier build a greenhouse in order to grow vegetables for profit. While I was there I stayed with a family for 5 nights, 
		and at the UGA Costa Rica Campus for 2 nights. My host family was very nice. My host mom's name was Marina, she worked at
		the UGA campus as a chef. My host dad's name was Miguel, he used to work temp jobs at UGA, but now works as a construction
		worker. Lastly, my host sister's name was Franciny, she was 16 years old and attends a high school in the next town over.
		My family also had two dogs, a cat, and a bunny. I love my host family, and we all had so much fun together.</p>
	<p>While there I was also able to travel to a small scale chocolate factory, explore the surrounding towns, hike at the Monteverde Cloud Forest, 
		go horseback riding through the mountains, and even went on the <span style="font-weight:bold">longest zipline in Latin America.</span> I 
		had never been on a zip line before I went to Costa Rica, so I was really scared to ride on it the frst time, but I am now hooked on zip 
		lining. I also had never ridden a horse before going to Costa Rica. The trails that we were taking our horses on were incredibly narrow,
		and they were through the mountains. The horses were experienced though, so it made riding easy. Our horseback riding guide, Martin, was really good
		at his job, and made the ride fun for all of us. My horse's name was Legolos. He had brown fur, and a light brown mane. Some of the other horses' names 
		were Texas, and Quijote.</p>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.externalaffairs.uga.edu/costa_rica/">UGA Costa Rica Campus</a> was so beautiful that it was hard 
		to leave. 
		I fell in love with everything and everyone in Costa Rica. Hopefully I will be able to travel back there over the summer. I would love to
		make it back there. The people I met were all so nice, and were incredibly genuine. It was difficult at first to communicate with everyone
		since they all speak Spanish, but by the end of the week I was able to confidently start a conversation in Spanish with anyone. By the end
		of the trip I was even thinking and dreaming in Spanish. Also, when I arrived back in Georgia, I would accidentally start speaking Spanish 
		to my friends. Like I mentioned before, I hope to be able to fly back and visit all of my Costa Rican friends in early July. I think Costa
		Rica could easily become my second home.</p>
